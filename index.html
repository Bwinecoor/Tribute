            Gerry McGovern was born in 1956 in Coventry, England. Became
            interested in art and wanted to be a painter around the age of 15,
            he even sold portraits to his teachers of their children for Â£5. He
            stated once that he thinks of cars as "Art on Wheels". His first car
            was the MGF sports car. This car got his name on the design map, and
            helped him become the chief designer of the Land Rover Freelander.

            Some of the cars that he designed are the MG EX-E, the MG F, the
            Land Rover Freelander MK 1, and the Land Rover Discovery MK4. Of
            these 4 famous works, my favorite is the MG EX-E, it has a nice
            slick design and just looks better than the rest.

            The style of the cars he designed are Sport Cars, Roadster Cars, and
            SUVs. These styles impact me by making me think more creatively, the styles show how unique one thing can be and how their different styles can be so different.
